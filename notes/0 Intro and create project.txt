App we are building is a staffing agency to manage a stable of heroes.

Application has many features you would expect in any data-driven application.

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to do the following:

    Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
    Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
    Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
    Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
    Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
    Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
    Format data with pipes.
    Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
    Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.

-
Create a project.

Create the initial project using the Angular CLI.

$ ng new angular-tour-of-heroes

$ cd angular-tour-of-heroes
$ ng serve --open

    the ng serve command builds the app, starts the development server,
    watches the source files, and rebuilds the application as you make 
    changes to those files.

    the --open flag opens a browser to http://localhost:4200/

The page you see is the application shell. The shell is controlled 
by an Angular component named AppComponent.

app.component.ts— the component class code, written in TypeScript.
app.component.html— the component template, written in HTML.
app.component.css— the component's private CSS styles.


    title = 'Tour of Heroes';

    then in template 

    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <!-- interpolation binding syntax -->
