add data persistence features with the 
help of Angular's HttpClient

Enable HTTP Services

    HttpClient is Angular's mechanism for 
    communicating with a remote server over HTTP

    making HttpClient available everywhere 
    in the application in two steps 

    in app.module.ts

        import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

        add HttpClientModule to the imports array

        @NgModule({
            imports: [
                HttpClientModule,
            ]
        })
